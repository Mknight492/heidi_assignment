For each guideline chunk, evaluate its relevance and provide a relevance score (0-100) based on:
1. Direct relevance to the condition
2. Applicability to patient demographics (age, weight)
3. Severity level match
4. Treatment recommendations included
5. Evidence quality

Return a JSON array with relevance scores:
