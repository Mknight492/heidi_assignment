I'm doing a take home assignment for a job interview. The assignment is included below in assignment.md
My current plan is included in plan.md
Ensure the plan and progress is updated with any changes
Ensure the readme is updated with any significant changes

The app is a next.js project with a React frontend and node.js backend

When using promppts these should be the ./app/prompts folder
