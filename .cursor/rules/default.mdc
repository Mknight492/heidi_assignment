I'm doing a take home assignment for a job interview. The assignment is included below in assignment.md
My current plan is included in plan.md
Ensure the plan and progress is updated with any changes

The app is a next.js project with a React frontend and node.js backend

When using promppts these should be the ./app/prompts folder

[assignment.md](mdc:assignment.md)
@plan.md
